**Inspiration Source:** [Andrey Zakirzyanov's artwork](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIwpQzoNLm3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)

This work adds a sense of 3D to a static painting *The Artist’s Garden at Vétheuil* by Claude Monet. Through the movement of the lens, we can feel the changes in the depth of field of the painting. In my works, I can also make them 3D. By scrolling with the mouse, users can change the depth of field and achieve interesting interactive effects.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

**Orbit Control**

The *Orbit Control* function in p5.js enables interactive 3D navigation using mouse or touch inputs, allowing users to rotate, pan, and zoom within a 3D scene. This interactivity is crucial for replicating the dynamic spatial transformations seen in the Instagram reel. By integrating *Orbit Control*, I can create an immersive experience where users can explore the artwork from multiple perspectives.
